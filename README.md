# Game-Reroll-Challenge

A lightweight, browser-based challenge tracker with local save support and seed import/export for easy sharing. Designed for streamers, speedrunners, and solo players.

## Features

- Local saves: Your progress and handicap database are stored privately in your browser.
- Seed system: Export or import your challenge state to back it up or share with others.
- No server required: Runs entirely in your browser.
- Streamer-friendly: Share a seed with your audience so they can follow along.
- Portable: Works anywhere you can open a modern web browser.

## How It Works

1. Track your progress by adding or updating your challenge state as you play.
2. Data is stored in your browser’s storage automatically.
3. Export a seed to create a shareable code containing your current challenge setup.
4. Import a seed to load someone else’s challenge or restore your own from a backup.

Even if you clear your browser cache or switch devices, you can restore your progress by importing your saved seed.
